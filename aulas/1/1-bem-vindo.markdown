## Bem vindo ao desenvolvimento Android

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}


Welcome to Developing Android Apps with Kotlin!
In order to take full advantage of this course, we recommend that you have fluency in the Kotlin programming language. If not, you can take our Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers course.

It is also helpful to have some basic understanding of:

SQLite: You will create a SQLite database in this course, so basic SQLite knowledge is useful. There is a short SQLite tutorial provided in that lesson.

Git and Github: The course code is kept in Github. You will need to be able to download the code from Github. Further git and github knowledge will allow you to better navigate the course code.

You will also need Android Studio to run the exercises in this course. Please visit System Requirements for more information.
